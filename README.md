##java-8-features

Simple code examples for showing what's new in 
[Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html).

They are based on the examples in the main [Java Tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/).

I'll be adding new features to the project on an ad-hoc basis; I have beer to drink and a day job buried in WebRTC!

### Current Features

1. Lambda
1. Aggregate operations
1. Default methods

Each feature is contained in its own package - the package-info will provide more details and the Test class 
will demonstrate how to use it.  Check the javadoc folder too.

The tests are written using [JUnit 4](http://junit.org/).

##### Features coming soon...

1. Date-Time API

##### A note on Eclipse IDE support

If you use the Eclipse IDE, you'll need to get the 
[Java 8 patch](https://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT/Eclipse_Java_8_Support_For_Kepler) udpate for it to recognise Java 8 code, 
e.g. lambda syntax.
