##java-8-features

Simple code examples for showing what's new in 
[Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html).

They are based on the examples in the main [Java Tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/).

I'll be adding new features to the project on an ad-hoc basis.

### Current Features

1. Lambda
1. Aggregate operations
1. Default methods

Each feature is contained in its own package - the package-info will provide more details and the Test class 
will demonstrate how to use it.

##### Features coming soon...

1. Date-Time API
